- Actively search LinkedIn for:
  - "Director Product Singapore"
  - "Head of Product Australia"
  - "VP Product Toronto/Vancouver"
- Filter by companies with visa sponsorship
- Target: Find 10-15 additional roles in these markets

---

#### B. Update Analysis Prompts to Include Relocation Context

**File:** `.claude/commands/analyze-job.md`

**Add Section:**
```markdown
## Geographic Fit Assessment

**Candidate's Location Preferences:**
- Current: London, UK (Bromley)
- Polish Passport: EU citizen (right to work across EU with no visa)
- Open to relocation: Singapore, Australia, Canada
- Not open to: Middle East (Dubai), Southeast Asia (except Singapore)

**Evaluate:**
- Does role location match preferences?
- Is visa sponsorship mentioned?
- Relocation package typically provided?
- Remote work possible from current location?

**Add to Fit Score Justification:**
- Deduct points if location is non-starter (Dubai, Bangkok)
- Neutral if EU (easy relocation)
- Note if Singapore/Australia/Canada (requires planning but interested)
```

---

#### C. Create Location-Specific Application Strategy

**Add to Career Preferences:**
```markdown
## Relocation Timeline & Planning

### Immediate (0-3 months): London/UK + Remote
- Can start immediately
- No relocation needed
- Prioritize these for quick wins

### Short-term (3-6 months): EU Relocation
- Polish passport = no visa delays
- Can relocate within 1-2 months
- Amsterdam, Berlin, Dublin most attractive

### Medium-term (6-12 months): Singapore/Australia/Canada
- Requires visa sponsorship
- Longer lead time (3-6 months for visa)
- Willing to start process for right opportunity
- Preference order: Singapore > Australia > Canada

### Application Strategy by Location:
- **London/UK:** Apply immediately to all high-fit roles
- **EU (Amsterdam, Dublin, Berlin):** Apply immediately (no visa barrier)
- **Singapore/Australia/Canada:** Apply selectively to 8-10+ fit scores (worth visa effort)
- **Other:** Case-by-case evaluation
```

---

### Priority 3: Enhanced AI Product Positioning (WEEK 2)

**Goal:** Reframe historical work + current upskilling to position for AI product roles

#### A. Audit Master CV for "Hidden AI Experience"

**Review each role for AI/ML elements:**

**Vrbo Director (2022-2024):**
- "AI-driven personalisation models" → ✅ Already mentioned
- What else? Predictive models? Recommendation systems? ML-powered bidding?

**Chase Director (2020-2022):**
- "Automated feedback loops" → Could this be ML-based?
- Any AI/ML in campaign optimization?

**Vrbo Senior PM (2018-2020):**
- CDP with AI-driven personalization → ✅ Already mentioned
- Behavioral analytics → ML models used?

**Action:**
Create `master/ai-experience-audit.md` listing every AI/ML touchpoint in career, even if minor. Use for interviews.

---

#### B. Create "AI Product Management" Skill Narrative

**For Cover Letters:**

**Template:**
```markdown
**Bridging Traditional PM and AI Product Management**

While my core expertise lies in data platforms and growth product management, I'm actively developing AI product capabilities through hands-on work. I recently built an AI-powered job application system using Claude Code CLI, demonstrating my ability to:

- Design multi-agent AI workflows with human-in-the-loop quality controls
- Balance automation with user control (a key challenge in AI products)
- Implement anti-hallucination safeguards and ethical AI constraints

**Implementation:**
Add to `.claude/commands/bulk-process.md`:
```markdown
## Post-Processing Options

After bulk analysis, run:

**Option 1: Analyze Top 10 in Detail**
```bash
/bulk-deep-dive --top 10
```
Reads full job descriptions for top 10 ranked roles and generates comprehensive analysis.

**Option 2: Analyze Specific Tier**
```bash
/bulk-deep-dive --tier1
```
Analyzes all Tier 1 roles (fit 8-10) in detail.
```

---

#### B. Add LinkedIn Integration (Future)

- Adjust strategy accordingly

**Example Insights:**
- "Data platform roles with 8+ fit score have 65% interview rate"
- "Applying within 48 hours improves odds by 30%"
- "Cover letters emphasizing [achievement X] get more responses"

---

#### B. A/B Testing for Application Components

**Test Variables:**
- Cover letter opening style (Achievement-First vs. Problem-Solution vs. Company-Specific)
- CV emphasis (Data Platform lead vs. Growth lead vs. Balanced)
- Application timing (within 24hrs vs. week 1 vs. later)

**Tracking:**
Log each variable in `cover-letter-log.md` and `cv-tailoring-notes.md`, then correlate with outcomes.

---
