## What Goes Here

   - Include ALL achievements, even if not relevant to every role
   - Keep dates, metrics, and company names accurate
   - This is never modified by the system, only read as reference

2. **YourName_MasterCV.pdf** - PDF version for easy reference

3. **cv-snippets.md** - Library of pre-written achievement bullets
   - Organized by theme (leadership, growth, technical, etc.)
