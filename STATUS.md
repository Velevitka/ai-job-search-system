### Priority 3: Geographic Expansion (NEXT WEEK)

  - Target 10-15 roles requiring visa sponsorship
  - Preference: Singapore > Australia > Canada
  - See: `ROADMAP.md` lines 201-284

### Priority 4: Review & Learn (ONGOING)

## Strategic Opportunities

**From ROADMAP.md:**
- [x] AI Product Positioning - COMPLETED (Master CV updated Nov 5)
- [ ] Geographic Reach Optimization - Next focus (Singapore/AU/CA search)
