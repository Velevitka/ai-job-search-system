## Next Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Wait for Current Application Responses
- **All 5 active applications** within expected 7-14 day response window
- **Why:** All applications recent (0-6 days old), too early to follow up
- **Status:** Monitoring daily for responses
- **Next milestone:** Nov 10 (Virgin Atlantic application deadline)

### Priority 2: Prepare Interview Materials (Proactive)
- [ ] **Prepare STAR stories** for common questions:
  - 0-to-1 data platform building (Vrbo CDP)
  - Multi-brand stakeholder management (20+ teams at Chase)
  - Marketing ROI optimization ($400M portfolio)
  - Team leadership and mentorship philosophy
  - AI product management upskilling journey

**Why:** With 5 strong applications (3 at 8.5-9/10 fit), statistically likely to receive interview invitations
**Effort:** 3-4 hours upfront preparation

### Priority 3: Geographic Expansion Research (Next Week)
- [ ] **Search for Singapore/Australia/Canada roles** (8-10 fit scores only)
  - Polish passport = EU mobility advantage (no visa for EU roles)
  - Target 10-15 roles requiring visa sponsorship
  - Preference: Singapore > Australia > Canada

**Timing:** Week 2 (Nov 11-17), after current pipeline settles

## Strategic Opportunities

**From ROADMAP.md:**
- [x] AI Product Positioning - COMPLETED ✅ (Master CV updated Nov 5)
- [ ] Geographic Reach Optimization - Next focus (Singapore/AU/CA search)
- [ ] Analytics & Learning - Awaiting response data (need 10+ responses for patterns)

## Inconsistencies Found

✅ **No major inconsistencies detected**

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Metrics dashboard shows "4 applications tracked (3 active, 1 withdrawn)" but actually have 5 active + 4 withdrawn + 1 rejected = 10 total folders
- **Resolution:** Metrics dashboard is outdated; this STATUS.md reflects current reality from application folders
- **Action:** Metrics dashboard will be updated during next `/weekly-review`

**Minor Notes:**
- Yelp rejection from August 2025 (before systematic tracking began) - limited detail available
- Some withdrawn applications have analysis.md but no CV/CL generated (early withdrawal decisions)

---

## Data Sources Checked

✅ `applications/*/status.md` - Individual application status (10 folders scanned)
✅ `insights/metrics-dashboard.md` - Aggregate metrics (needs update)
✅ `docs/reference/ROADMAP.md` - Strategic priorities

- ⚠️ Metrics dashboard count slightly outdated (expected - will update on weekly review)

**Folders Scanned:** 10
**Status Files Read:** 10
**PDFs Found:** 6 CVs, 5 Cover Letters (Yelp has CV but no CL - withdrawn before CL generation)

- ✅ Redcare: CV + CL (complete)
- ✅ SumUp: CV + CL v3 (complete, multiple versions iterated)
- ✅ Angi: CV + CL (complete)

- ✅ Booksy: Analysis only (withdrawn during CV planning)
