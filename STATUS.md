## Next Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Monitor Active Applications (THIS WEEK)

All 5 applications are within expected 7-14 day response window:
- **Virgin Atlantic (6 days):** Application deadline Nov 10 approaching - monitor closely
- **Angi & Redcare (both 9/10 fit):** High-priority opportunities, expect responses soon
- **SumUp (5 days):** Check MyGreenhouse portal for status updates
- **Storio (0 days):** Just submitted today

**Recommended:** Wait for responses before submitting new applications. Strong pipeline coverage with excellent quality (avg 8.2/10 fit).

### Priority 2: Prepare Interview Materials (PROACTIVE)

- [ ] **Prepare STAR stories** for common questions:
  - 0-to-1 data platform building (Vrbo CDP)
  - Multi-brand stakeholder management (20+ teams at Chase)
  - Marketing ROI optimization ($400M portfolio)
  - Team leadership and mentorship philosophy
  - AI product management upskilling journey

**Why:** With 5 strong applications (3 at 8.5-9/10 fit), statistically likely to receive interview invitations
**Impact:** Reduces prep time from 4-6 hours to 1-2 hours when invitation arrives
**Effort:** 3-4 hours upfront preparation

### Priority 3: Update LinkedIn Profile with AI Product Work

- [ ] **Add to About section:** AI Product Management upskilling narrative
- [ ] **Add Featured Project:** AI Job Search System (link to GitHub if public)
- [ ] **Post about learning:** "Building AI product management expertise through hands-on development..."

**Why:** Strengthens positioning for AI product roles, demonstrates genuine upskilling
**Impact:** Recruiter visibility, thought leadership credibility
**Effort:** 1-2 hours

### Priority 4: Geographic Expansion Research (NEXT WEEK)

- [ ] **Search for Singapore/Australia/Canada roles** (8-10 fit scores only)
  - Polish passport = EU mobility advantage (no visa for EU roles)
  - Target 10-15 roles requiring visa sponsorship
  - Preference: Singapore > Australia > Canada
  - See: `ROADMAP.md` lines 201-284

**Timing:** Week 2 (Nov 11-17), after current pipeline settles

---

## Strategic Opportunities

**From ROADMAP.md:**
- [x] AI Product Positioning - COMPLETED ✅ (Master CV updated Nov 5)
- [ ] Geographic Reach Optimization - Next focus (Singapore/AU/CA search)
- [ ] Analytics & Learning - Awaiting response data (need 10+ responses for patterns)

**Key Strategic Insight:**
Focus on 8+ fit scores with London/remote locations is working exceptionally well. Average fit score of 8.2/10 for active applications indicates strong quality-over-quantity approach is paying off.
