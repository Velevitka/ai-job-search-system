## ❌ Filtered Out / Lower Priority

- Dubai roles (Laine - must relocate)
- Contract roles (WPP AI Product Owner - 6 months)
- Too junior (various Senior PM roles at mid-level companies)
- Wrong focus (Responsible AI Mobilisation - Lloyds)

---

## THE SORTING PROBLEM YOU IDENTIFIED

**Issue:** "Scoring works relatively well, but we don't keep sort order"

**What's happening:**
1. Batch 1 (Oct): Analyzed 20 jobs → tier1, tier2
2. Batch 2 (Nov 5): Analyzed 10 NEW jobs → created NEW priorities
3. **Result:** Old tier1 jobs (Hopper, loveholidays, Holiday Extras) are BURIED
4. **New analysis prioritized:** Redpin (8.5/10) but MISSED travel roles (your #1 preference)

**Root cause:** No master priority queue maintained across batches.

---

## CORRECTED PRIORITY ORDER (With Career Preferences Weight)

**Career preferences scoring:**
- Travel/Hospitality: +2 bonus points
- AdTech/MarTech: +1.5 bonus points
- Director/Head level: +2 bonus points
- FinTech: +1 bonus point

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Today (Nov 5 Evening)

**1. Reorganize staging folder → Approach 3 (Pipeline)**
```bash
/reorganize-staging approach3
```

**2. Re-analyze travel roles FIRST (before Redpin):**

Priority order:
```bash
# 1. loveholidays (travel + head level)
/analyze-job loveholidays [paste mhtml content]

# 2. Hopper Supply (travel + marketplace)
/analyze-job Hopper [paste mhtml content]

# 3. Holiday Extras (travel + head)
/analyze-job Holiday-Extras [paste mhtml content]

# Then if still interested:
# 4. Moloco (AdTech platform)
# 5. TRKKN (AdTech EMEA)
# 6. Redpin (FinTech platform)
```

### This Week (Nov 5-12)

**Target:** Apply to top 3-5 travel/AdTech roles
**Why:** These align with career preferences (#1 = travel, #2 = AdTech) better than FinTech

---

## SYSTEM FIXES NEEDED (For Productization)

**Problem:** Batch isolation - each bulk-process creates isolated priority list

**Solution:** Maintain persistent master shortlist

**Implementation:**
```python
# In /bulk-process:
1. Load existing MASTER-SHORTLIST.md
2. Merge NEW jobs with EXISTING opportunities
3. Re-score ALL jobs (not just new batch)
4. Apply career preferences weights
5. Sort by weighted fit score
6. Update MASTER-SHORTLIST.md
7. Show top 10 across ALL batches
```

**Code changes needed:**
- `scripts/bulk_analyze.py`: Add "merge with existing shortlist" step
- Career preferences weighting function
- Persistent priority queue (not batch-isolated)

---

## YOUR FEEDBACK INCORPORATED

**"Redpin popped on top but I like it, don't love it"**
- ✅ Fixed: Redpin is FinTech, not travel (your #1 preference)
- ✅ Travel roles (Hopper, loveholidays, Holiday Extras) now correctly ranked higher

**"Scoring works relatively well, but we don't keep sort order"**
- ✅ Root cause identified: Batch isolation
- ✅ Solution: Master shortlist with persistent priority queue
- ✅ Immediate fix: This document consolidates ALL batches

**"I love this system, considering productizing it"**
- ✅ Reorganize to Approach 3 (Pipeline) - production-ready structure
- ✅ This bug fix is CRITICAL for product-market fit
- ✅ No product can succeed if it buries user's top opportunities

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Decision time:**

1. **Agree with re-prioritization?** (Travel > AdTech > FinTech based on preferences)
2. **Start with loveholidays or Hopper?** (Both are gold)
3. **Reorganize staging today?** (Approach 3 for product readiness)

**I recommend:**
- Analyze loveholidays FIRST (Head level + travel + selling platform)
- Then Hopper (marketplace + supply PM)
- Skip Redpin for now (good fit, but not aligned with travel preference)

**Ready to proceed?**
```bash
# Extract loveholidays JD from MHTML:
Read staging/tier1-apply-now/Head of Product - Selling @ loveholidays.mhtml

# Then:
/analyze-job loveholidays
```

**This is why persistent priority queues matter in product management.** 🎯
