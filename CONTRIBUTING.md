# 3. Create your personal data folders (not tracked by git)
mkdir -p master applications insights staging archive

# 4. Add your master CV for testing
cp /path/to/your/cv.docx master/YourName_MasterCV.docx

1. Read through as a new user would
2. Verify all links work
3. Check formatting renders correctly
4. Test any code examples

### Submitting a Pull Request
