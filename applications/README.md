# Applications Folder

This folder contains all your job applications. Each application gets its own subfolder with analysis, tailored CV, and tracking information.

## Folder Structure

Each application folder follows this naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-CompanyName-RoleTitle/
```

Example: `2025-01-Meta-SeniorGrowthPM/`

## What's Inside Each Application Folder

Generated by the system:

1. **job-description.md** - Saved job description with keywords extracted
2. **analysis.md** - Fit score, strong points, gaps, and CV strategy
3. **cv-tailoring-plan.md** - Proposed CV modifications (human-reviewed)
4. **YourName_CV_Company.md** - Tailored CV in markdown format
5. **YourName_CV_Company.pdf** - Final PDF generated via Pandoc
6. **cv-changes-log.md** - What was modified from master CV
7. **YourName_CoverLetter_Company.md** - Cover letter (if generated)
8. **application-tracker.md** - Status tracking for this application

Optional (created as needed):
- **interviews/** subfolder - Interview prep and transcripts
- **follow-up-notes.md** - Communication log with company
- **offer-details.md** - If you receive an offer

## Application Lifecycle

1. **Analysis Phase** - Job analyzed, fit score calculated
2. **CV Tailoring** - Tailored CV created and approved
3. **Applied** - Application submitted
4. **Interview** - Interview scheduled/completed
5. **Offer** or **Rejected** - Final outcome

## Important Notes

- **This folder is in .gitignore** - Your applications never get committed to git
- Each folder is self-contained with all documents for that application
- Status updates are tracked in application-tracker.md
- Keep all communication and notes in the application folder
