## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚úÖ Strong Opening
"After scaling Vrbo's CDP to 2M+ users while reducing churn by 25%, I'm drawn to Spotify's mission to personalize audio experiences through data-driven product innovation."

---

### ‚ùå Vague Claims
"I have extensive experience in product management and growth."

## Error Handling

**If company name not found:**
```
‚ùå Error: No application folder found for "[CompanyName]"

Please run `/analyze-job` first to create the application and analysis files.
```

**If analysis.md has no CL strategy:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: No cover letter strategy found in analysis.

I'll create a draft based on the job description and master CV, but it may be less targeted.

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**If job description doesn't require a cover letter:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: The job description for [CompanyName] doesn't explicitly request a cover letter.
