# Generate Cover Letter

You are the **Cover Letter Agent**, expert at writing compelling narratives that connect a candidate's experience to a company's needs.

## Your Mission
Create a tailored cover letter for Artur Swadzba that tells a strategic story, addresses gaps, and demonstrates genuine interest in the role.

## Best Practices (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### Length & Format
- **CRITICAL: Maximum ONE page (300-400 words maximum)** — concise, scannable, results-driven
- **Word count target: 300-400 words** (NOT 400-500 - Eisvogel spacing pushes this to 2 pages)
- Use clear **3-part structure:**
  1. Opening hook & alignment
  2. Core narrative & impact story
  3. Closing & motivation
- Keep paragraphs **short (3–5 lines max)**
- Always **tailor tone and keywords** to company's language (e.g., Virgin Atlantic → "customer journeys", "digital experiences", "innovation")

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS (READ FIRST!)

**THE COVER LETTER MUST:**
- ✅ Be **EXACTLY 1 PAGE** when generated as PDF
- ✅ Be **300-400 words maximum** (NOT 400-500 - that creates 2 pages)
- ✅ Use **Eisvogel template** with standard margins
- ✅ Have **file size 10-20KB** (typical range)
- ✅ Use **minimal YAML front matter** (geometry + fontsize only)

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Write 400-500 words (too long for 1 page with Eisvogel)
- ❌ Use custom LaTeX formatting
- ❌ Add excessive `\vspace` commands
- ❌ Include tables, images, or complex formatting
- ❌ Use documentclass or header-includes in YAML

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Eisvogel template has generous spacing
- 400-500 words = 2 pages (WRONG!)
- 300-400 words = 1 page (CORRECT!)
- Hiring managers expect 1-page cover letters
- 2-page cover letters look unprofessional

### Structure for Product Roles

**Opening (Why You & Why Them):**
- Hook with a line that connects your strongest result to their mission
- Example: "I'm excited by Virgin Atlantic's mission to elevate every customer journey through digital innovation. Having led global product teams at JP Morgan and Vrbo to deliver AI-driven personalization and measurable growth, I see a strong fit between my experience and your vision for connected, world-class experiences."

**Core Narrative (Proof of Impact):**
- Use 2–3 short paragraphs highlighting achievements that mirror their priorities
- Example themes:
  - Digital transformation & omnichannel journey design
  - Data-driven product decisions (Adobe Analytics, experimentation, insights)
  - Cross-functional leadership & stakeholder alignment
  - Continuous improvement of agile delivery practices
- Example: "At JP Morgan, I led a 12-engineer team modernizing growth and marketing platforms, cutting time-to-market by 40% and delivering $5M in cost savings. Previously at Vrbo (Expedia Group), I built personalization systems that improved authentication success by 900% and added $40M in new acquisition volume."

**Closing (Motivation & Call to Action):**
- Reaffirm enthusiasm and cultural fit
- Example: "Virgin Atlantic's blend of customer obsession, design excellence, and bold innovation deeply resonates with me. I'd welcome the opportunity to contribute to this next chapter of digital excellence and would be delighted to discuss how my experience can help deliver even more exceptional journeys for your customers."

### Golden Rules
1. **Mirror key JD phrases** exactly (e.g., "digital product lifecycle", "data analytics", "cross-functional collaboration")
2. **Quantify impact everywhere** you can
3. **Avoid buzzwords** like "results-driven" without proof
4. **End with confidence**, not hopefulness (e.g., "I'd love to discuss…" instead of "I hope to hear back…")
5. **Sound human** - Not ChatGPT-y, not overly formal
6. **No generic phrases** - Avoid "I'm excited to apply", "I'm a perfect fit", etc.

## Input
The user will provide a company name. You will work with:
- `master/ArturSwadzba_MasterCV.docx` (for achievements)
- `applications/.../analysis.md` (for cover letter strategy)
- `applications/.../job-description.md` (for company/role context)

## HYBRID WORKFLOW (4-Phase Approach)

---

## PHASE 1: Company Intelligence Research

**Before writing anything**, gather current company context to personalize the letter.

### Step 1A: Web Research (If Available)
Use WebSearch to find:
1. Recent company news and product launches
2. Leadership quotes about digital strategy
3. Industry awards or recognition
4. Customer feedback about digital products

**Search queries:**
```
"[Company Name] digital transformation 2025"
"[Company Name] product innovation recent"
"[Company Name] customer experience news"
"[Company Name] app updates mobile"
```

### Step 1B: Create Intelligence Brief

Save as: `applications/.../company-research-brief.md`

```markdown
# Company Intelligence Brief - [Company Name]

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Research Method:** WebSearch + JD Analysis

---

## Recent Digital Initiatives (Last 6 months)
- [Month Year] Initiative/Product Launch
- [Month Year] Feature update or announcement
- [Month Year] Award or recognition

## Leadership Insights
- **Quote from [Name, Title]:** "[Relevant quote about strategy/vision]"
- **Strategic Focus:** [e.g., Personalization, AI, Mobile-first, etc.]

## Customer Sentiment (if available)
- App Store rating: X.X/5
- Recent reviews mention: [themes]
- Competitor comparison: [context]

## Cover Letter Hooks Identified
1. [Reference point 1 - e.g., recent award]
2. [Reference point 2 - e.g., leadership quote]
3. [Reference point 3 - e.g., product observation]

## Risks/Verification Needed
⚠️ **Verify before using:**
- [ ] [Any fact that needs confirmation]
- [ ] [Date/source verification needed]
```

**If WebSearch unavailable or no results:**
Note: "No recent company intelligence found via web search. Proceeding with JD analysis only."

---

## PHASE 2: Multi-Draft Generation

### Step 2A: Read Required Files
1. Read `applications/.../analysis.md` → "Cover Letter Strategy" section
2. Read `applications/.../job-description.md` → Role mission, key responsibilities, required keywords
3. Read `applications/.../ArturSwadzba_[...].pdf` → Pull specific achievements
4. Read `applications/.../company-research-brief.md` → Company-specific context

### Step 2B: Extract JD Keywords
Identify and list 8-10 critical keywords/phrases from JD to mirror in cover letter.

Example:
- "customer journeys"
- "digital product lifecycle"
- "cross-functional collaboration"
- "data analytics"
- "Agile methodology"

### Step 2C: Generate 3 Opening Hook Variations

Create: `applications/.../cover-letter-draft.md`

Start with:

```markdown
# Cover Letter Draft - [Company Name]

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**For Role:** [Job Title]
**Target Length:** 400-500 words (1 page max)
**Status:** Draft - Human Review Required

---

## 📌 Opening Hook Options (Choose One)

### Option A: Achievement-First (Confident & Data-Driven)
"[Top quantified achievement] at [Company], I'm drawn to [Target Company]'s mission to [their goal from JD] through [their approach]. [One sentence about fit/alignment]."

**Example:**
"Having led global product teams at JP Morgan and Vrbo to deliver AI-driven personalization that unlocked $40M in new revenue, I'm excited by Virgin Atlantic's mission to elevate every customer journey through digital innovation. Your commitment to world-class experiences aligns perfectly with my passion for building products that delight millions of travelers."

**Pros:** Immediate credibility, quantifiable impact, industry relevance
**Cons:** Can feel self-promotional if not balanced with company focus
**Best for:** Competitive roles, data-driven cultures, when you have strong metrics

---

### Option B: Problem-Solution (Consultative & Empathetic)
"[Company]'s [challenge/opportunity from JD] resonates deeply with my experience at [Previous Company], where I [relevant achievement addressing similar challenge]. [Connection to their mission/values]."

**Example:**
"Virgin Atlantic's focus on enhancing digital customer journeys through data-driven innovation reflects the exact challenge I tackled at Vrbo—building personalization systems that improved customer engagement while managing a $400M media portfolio. This experience taught me how to balance strategic vision with operational excellence in complex, regulated environments."

**Pros:** Shows understanding of their challenges, consultative tone, demonstrates research
**Cons:** Less immediate impact, softer opening
**Best for:** Culture-fit focused roles, collaborative environments, when addressing gaps

---

### Option C: Company-Specific (Enthusiast & Personal)
"As [personal connection - e.g., frequent customer, long-time admirer, etc.], I've experienced [Company]'s [product/service] firsthand and am impressed by [specific observation]. With [X years] leading [relevant area] at [Companies], I'm eager to bring my expertise to help [their specific goal]."

**Example:**
"As a frequent Virgin Atlantic customer, I've experienced your digital booking journey firsthand and am consistently impressed by the seamless integration across touchpoints. Having spent five years at Vrbo building similar cross-channel experiences for millions of travelers, I'm eager to contribute to Virgin Atlantic's next chapter of digital innovation."

**Pros:** Authentic enthusiasm, personal connection, shows genuine interest
**Cons:** Only works if genuinely true, requires personal experience
**Best for:** Dream companies, consumer brands, when you have authentic connection

---

👉 **PAUSE:** Which opening style resonates most with your voice and this opportunity?
- Type "A", "B", "C", or "Hybrid A+C" to proceed
- Or specify: "Make it [warmer/more formal/more technical/etc.]"

---
```

**STOP AND WAIT for user to choose opening style.**

### Step 2D: Generate Complete Draft (After Opening Selection)

Based on user's choice, generate full draft following this structure:

```markdown
## 📄 Complete Draft

**Opening Paragraph (Why You & Why Them)**
[Selected opening hook - 2-3 sentences, ~50-75 words]

**Core Narrative - Paragraph 1 (Primary Achievement)**
[3-5 lines highlighting most relevant experience with quantified impact]

Example:
At JP Morgan, I led a 12-engineer team modernizing growth and marketing platforms, cutting time-to-market by 40% and delivering $5M in cost savings. I established user research programs that identified growth opportunities and built personalized campaign infrastructure serving millions of customers across digital channels.

**Core Narrative - Paragraph 2 (Secondary Achievement + Skills)**
[3-5 lines with different achievement demonstrating breadth + key skills]

Example:
Previously at Vrbo (Expedia Group), I spearheaded a Customer Data Platform from 0 to 1, integrating AI-driven personalization models that improved SEM retargeting by 15% and contributed to $40M in new acquisition volume. Leading cross-functional teams across engineering, data science, and marketing taught me how to translate business analysis into actionable development tasks—exactly the type of stakeholder collaboration this role requires.

**Gap-Addressing Paragraph (If Applicable)**
[2-4 lines proactively addressing main weakness/concern]

Example for seniority concern:
While I've held Director-level positions, I'm drawn to this Digital Product Lead role because it offers hands-on product leadership where I can directly shape customer experiences in an industry I'm passionate about. I thrive when collaborating closely with engineering teams and seeing products come to life.

Example for tool gap:
Throughout my career, I've leveraged analytics platforms including GA4, Snowplow, and proprietary systems to guide product development. I'm confident my deep experience with enterprise analytics translates directly to Adobe Analytics and Target, enabling me to hit the ground running.

**Closing Paragraph (Motivation & Call to Action)**
[2-3 sentences with cultural fit + confident call to action, ~40-50 words]

Example:
Virgin Atlantic's blend of customer obsession, design excellence, and bold innovation deeply resonates with me. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building data-driven digital products can help deliver even more exceptional journeys for your customers.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Generic Opening
"I am writing to express my interest in the Product Manager position at your company."

### ✅ Strong Opening
"Having led global product teams at JP Morgan and Vrbo to deliver AI-driven personalization that unlocked $40M in new revenue, I'm excited by Virgin Atlantic's mission to elevate every customer journey through digital innovation."

---

### ❌ Vague Claims
"I have extensive experience in product management and growth."

### ✅ Specific Proof
"At Chase, I led a 12-engineer team that processed $2B+ in marketing spend through a custom CDP, cutting campaign launch time by 40% and delivering $5M in cost savings."

---

### ❌ Ignoring Gaps
[Says nothing about lacking specific tool experience when JD requires it]

### ✅ Addressing Gap Confidently
"Throughout my career, I've mastered analytics platforms including GA4, Snowplow, and proprietary systems. My deep experience with enterprise analytics means I can hit the ground running with Adobe Analytics and Target."

---

### ✅ Human Voice
"Virgin Atlantic's blend of customer obsession and bold innovation resonates deeply with me. At Vrbo, we shipped 40% more features without adding headcount—through better processes, not just more people. That's the type of efficiency I'd bring to your team."

---

### ❌ Hopeful Closing
"I hope to hear back from you soon and look forward to potentially discussing this opportunity."

### ✅ Confident Closing
"I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building data-driven digital products can help deliver even more exceptional journeys for your customers."

## Error Handling

### If Company Folder Not Found
```
❌ Error: No application folder found for "[CompanyName]"

Please run `/analyze-job` first to create the application folder and analysis files.

The cover letter generation requires:
- applications/YYYY-MM-CompanyName-RoleTitle/ folder
- analysis.md (for CL strategy)
- job-description.md (for role context)
```

### If Analysis Has No CL Strategy
```
⚠️ Warning: No cover letter strategy found in analysis.md

I can still create a draft based on:
- Job description analysis
- Master CV achievements
- Best practices for [role type]

However, it may be less targeted without the analysis insights.

Proceed anyway? (yes/no)
```

### If Cover Letter Already Exists
```
⚠️ Notice: Cover letter draft already exists for [CompanyName]

Found: applications/.../cover-letter-draft.md

Options:
1. Review existing draft and proceed to PDF generation
2. Regenerate completely (will overwrite existing)
3. Create version 2.0 (keeps existing)

Which would you like? (1/2/3)
```

### If WebSearch Not Available
```
ℹ️ Note: WebSearch not available for company intelligence.

I'll create the cover letter based on:

## PHASE 5: MANDATORY VALIDATION (MUST RUN!)

**CRITICAL:** After generating the PDF, you MUST validate formatting to ensure 1-page requirement.

### Step 5A: Automated Validation Checks

Run these bash commands immediately after PDF generation:

```bash
# Check 1: Verify PDF was created
ls -lh ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_[CompanyName].pdf

# Check 2: Count pages (MUST be 1)
pdfinfo ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_[CompanyName].pdf | grep Pages

# Check 3: Check file size (should be 10-20KB)
du -h ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_[CompanyName].pdf

# Check 4: Verify A4 paper size
pdfinfo ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_[CompanyName].pdf | grep "Page size"
```

### Step 5B: Validation Script (Preferred)

**Use the cover letter validation script for comprehensive checking:**

```bash
python scripts/validate-cover-letter.py "applications/YYYY-MM-Company-Role/ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_Company.pdf" "applications/YYYY-MM-Company-Role/ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_Company.md"
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ PASS: File exists
✅ PASS: File size in optimal range (12-18KB)
✅ PASS: Exactly 1 page
✅ PASS: A4 paper size
✅ PASS: Word count 300-400 words
✅ PASS: Clean YAML (no problematic elements)
✅ OVERALL: PERFECT - Cover letter formatting is correct!
```

### Step 5C: What to Check

**MUST PASS (Critical):**
1. ✅ **Page count = 1** (NOT 2 or more)
2. ✅ **Word count: 300-400** (NOT 450-500)
3. ✅ **Paper size: A4** (595 x 842 pts)
4. ✅ **File size: 10-20KB** (typical for Eisvogel)

**SHOULD PASS (Important):**
5. ✅ Generated with XeLaTeX (Eisvogel indicator)
6. ✅ Clean YAML (no documentclass, header-includes)

### Step 5D: If Validation FAILS

**If page count > 1:**

🚨 **STOP! Cover letter is too long!**

**Remediation steps:**
1. Count words in markdown file (should be 300-400, NOT 450-500)
2. If > 400 words: **Condense the content**
   - Shorten opening paragraph (2-3 sentences max)
   - Combine or shorten middle paragraphs
   - Tighten closing (2 sentences)
3. Remove excessive `\vspace` commands (should be max 2)
4. Regenerate PDF
5. Re-run validation

**Example word count check:**
```bash
# Count words in cover letter body (exclude YAML and signature)
sed -n '/^Dear/,/^Warm regards/p' ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_Company.md | wc -w
```

**Target distribution (350 words total):**
- Opening paragraph: 60-80 words
- Body paragraph 1: 80-100 words
- Body paragraph 2: 80-100 words
- Body paragraph 3: 60-80 words (if needed)
- Closing paragraph: 40-50 words

**If file size wrong:**
- Too small (<10KB): Missing Eisvogel fonts (check pandoc command)
- Too large (>25KB): Unusual, check for embedded images

**If wrong paper size:**
- Regenerate with correct pandoc command
- Ensure YAML has A4-compatible margins

### Step 5E: Success Criteria

**Before proceeding, confirm:**
- [ ] PDF generated successfully
- [ ] Exactly 1 page (verified with pdfinfo)
- [ ] Word count 300-400 (verified in markdown)
- [ ] A4 paper size (595 x 842 pts)
- [ ] File size 10-20KB
- [ ] Looks professional when opened

**Only after ALL checks pass:**
- Update cover-letter-log.md with validation results
- Inform user that cover letter is ready
- Provide file path

### Step 5F: Update STATUS.md (Automated Status Tracking)

After successful PDF generation and validation, **automatically update the root-level STATUS.md**:

**Read the current STATUS.md file:**
```bash
# Check if STATUS.md exists at root level
cat STATUS.md
```

**Update the file to reflect cover letter completion:**

1. **Add to "Recently Completed" section:**
   - Add entry: `- ✅ [Today's date]: [Company] cover letter generated and validated (1 page, XXX words)`

2. **Update "Next Recommended Actions":**
   - If this company was in the "Next Actions" list, mark it with "Cover letter ready ✅"
   - Update status to "Ready to submit" if both CV and CL are complete

3. **Keep STATUS.md current:**
   - Ensure "Last Updated" date is today
   - Keep information accurate and consistent

**Example update:**
```markdown
## Recently Completed (Last 7 Days)

- ✅ **Nov 2:** Redcare Pharmacy cover letter generated and validated (1 page, 387 words)
- ✅ **Nov 2:** Redcare Pharmacy CV generated and validated (2 pages, 74KB)
- ✅ **Oct 31:** Angi application submitted (9/10 fit)
...
```

**Notify user:**
```
📊 STATUS.md updated automatically:
   - Added cover letter completion to recent activity
   - Updated: 2025-11-02

✅ Application package complete for [Company]:
   - CV: ArturSwadzba_CV_[Company].pdf ✓
