# Current Status Check

You are helping the user understand the current state of their job search by checking actual files and generating an accurate, up-to-date status report.

## ⚡ NEW BEHAVIOR (Nov 5, 2025)

This command now **AUTO-REGENERATES STATUS.md** from application folders to ensure it's always accurate.

**What this means:**
- STATUS.md is treated as a **DERIVED VIEW** (disposable, regenerable)
- Application folders (`applications/*/status.md`) are the **SOURCE OF TRUTH**
- Any manual edits to STATUS.md will be overwritten
- STATUS.md will always reflect current reality

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive current status report by:

### 1. Check Active Applications

**Search for application folders:**
- List all folders in `applications/` directory using Glob
- For each folder, read the `status.md` file
- Extract key information:
  - Company name
  - Role title
  - Fit score
  - Application date (from status.md)
  - Current status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
  - Days since application (calculate from date to today)

**Identify application completion:**
- Check for PDF files: `ArturSwadzba_CV_*.pdf` and `ArturSwadzba_CoverLetter_*.pdf`
- If both PDFs exist + status.md shows "Applied" = Complete application
- If analysis.md exists but no PDFs = Analysis done, application pending

### 2. Identify Pending Work

**Check for analyzed roles not yet applied:**
- Scan `applications/` folders without complete PDFs
- Check `docs/history/ARCHIVE-SUMMARY.md` for analyzed roles
- Cross-reference with `docs/reference/ROADMAP.md` for priority order

**Priority ranking:**
1. Tier 1 roles (fit 9-10) - apply immediately
2. Strategic priorities from docs/reference/ROADMAP.md (e.g., Update Master CV)
3. Tier 2 roles (fit 8-9) - apply this week
4. Geographic expansion opportunities

### 3. Check Metrics Dashboard

Read `insights/metrics-dashboard.md` for:
- Total applications submitted count
- Interview invitations count
- Open applications awaiting response
- Any inconsistencies with application folders

### 4. Consult Strategic Documents

**docs/reference/ROADMAP.md:**
- Current week priorities
- Strategic improvements (e.g., AI product positioning)
- Time-sensitive actions

**career-preferences.md (if exists):**
- Role criteria filters
- Location preferences
- Deal-breakers

### 5. Validate Data Consistency

**Before generating, check for inconsistencies:**
- [ ] Compare application folder count vs. metrics dashboard count
- [ ] Check for folders without status.md files
- [ ] Check for status.md files showing "applied" but missing PDFs
- [ ] Check for PDFs existing but status.md showing "in_progress"
- [ ] Calculate days waiting accurately (today's date - application date)
- [ ] Verify fit scores match analysis.md files
- [ ] Flag any orphaned data

**If inconsistencies found:**
- List them clearly in the "Inconsistencies Found" section
- Explain what the discrepancy is
- Recommend how to fix it

### 6. Generate STATUS.md File

**IMPORTANT:** After generating the report, **WRITE IT TO STATUS.md**

Use the Write tool to create/overwrite `STATUS.md` with the generated content.

**Format the content exactly as follows:**

```markdown
# Current Status - Job Search

**Last Updated:** [Today's Date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
**Generated By:** `/status` command (auto-regenerated from application folders)
**Active Since:** October 2025

## Rules & Best Practices

**CRITICAL:**
1. **Always verify state from files** - Never assume or rely on memory
2. **Calculate days waiting** - Use today's date (2025-11-05) minus application date
3. **Trust hierarchy:** Application folders > metrics-dashboard > other docs
4. **Flag inconsistencies** - If files conflict, report it clearly
5. **Never use docs/history/ARCHIVE-SUMMARY.md** for current state - it's historical only
6. **WRITE STATUS.md FILE** - After generating report, use Write tool to save it
7. **Add timestamp** - Include generation date/time in ISO format
8. **Validate before writing** - Check all data for consistency

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] All application folders checked
- [ ] All status.md files read
- [ ] Metrics dashboard consulted
- [ ] docs/reference/ROADMAP.md priorities reviewed
- [ ] Days calculated correctly
- [ ] Inconsistencies flagged

**Output quality:**
- Use exact fit scores from analysis files
- Calculate accurate "days waiting"
- Provide specific next actions with reasoning
- Include file paths for easy navigation
- Highlight time-sensitive items

## Example Usage

**User types:** `/status`

**You do:**
1. Use Glob to find all `applications/*/status.md` files
2. Read each status.md file (parse status, dates, fit scores)
3. Check for PDFs in each folder (verify completion)
4. Read metrics-dashboard.md (for aggregate context)
5. Read docs/reference/ROADMAP.md (for strategic priorities)
6. **VALIDATE:** Check for inconsistencies between sources
7. **CALCULATE:** Days waiting, averages, counts, stats
8. **GENERATE:** Comprehensive status report markdown
9. **WRITE:** Use Write tool to save to `STATUS.md` (overwrites existing)
10. **DISPLAY:** Show the user the generated report

**User sees:**
- Generated STATUS.md file (updated/created)
- Clear current state
- Accurate application counts
- Validation report showing data quality
- Prioritized next actions with reasoning
- No confusion about what's done vs. pending
- Timestamp showing when report was generated

**Key Difference from Before:**
- ❌ Before: Generated report to screen only (STATUS.md manually maintained)
- ✅ Now: Generates report AND writes to STATUS.md file (auto-maintained)
