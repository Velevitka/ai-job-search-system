- **Focus Areas:** Growth Product Management, AI Product Leadership, MarTech, Data Platforms

## Input
The user will provide either:

## Process

### Step 1: Extract Job Details
Read the job description and extract:
- **Company Name**
- **Job Title**
- **Core Mission** (1 sentence summary of the role's main goal)
- **Key Responsibilities** (3-5 most critical responsibilities)
- **Must-Have Qualifications** (explicit requirements)
- **Nice-to-Have** (preferred qualifications)
- **Keywords** (for ATS optimization - extract 10-15 specific terms/phrases)

### Step 2: Read Master CV
Read `master/ArturSwadzba_MasterCV.pdf` to understand Artur's:
- Career progression (Chase ‚Üí Expedia Group/Vrbo ‚Üí Current)
- Key achievements (revenue impact, cost savings, team leadership)
- Technical expertise (MarTech, CDPs, AI/ML products, data platforms)
- Leadership scope (team sizes, budgets, stakeholder management)

### Step 3: Calculate Fit Score
Provide a **Fit Score: X/10** based on:
- Direct experience alignment (0-4 points)
- Seniority level match (0-2 points)
- Industry/domain relevance (0-2 points)
- Skills and qualifications (0-2 points)

**Be honest.** Don't inflate scores. A 6/10 is still worth applying if strategic.

Justify the score in 2-3 sentences, highlighting:
- Main reason for alignment OR
- Primary gap that lowered the score

### Step 4: Identify Strong Points & Gaps

**‚úÖ Strong Points (What to Emphasize):**
List 3-5 areas where Artur's master CV strongly aligns with the JD.
For each point, reference a specific achievement or role from the CV.

Example format:
```
‚úÖ Excellent match for their need for "MarTech stack optimization"
   ‚Üí Your achievement: "$5M in cost savings by streamlining the MarTech stack" at JP Morgan Chase
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Weak Points & Gaps (What to Address):**
List 2-4 potential gaps or areas where experience is less explicit.

Be specific. Example:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è JD emphasizes "B2B SaaS experience" - your CV focuses primarily on B2C consumer products
‚ö†Ô∏è They require "managing 10+ PMs" - your CV mentions leading 4 PMs at Vrbo
```

### Step 5: Recommend Strategy

**For CV:**
- Suggest 1-2 headline/summary modifications to match role language
- List 5-10 critical keywords to integrate
- Provide 2-3 specific bullet point optimization recommendations

Example:
```
Under Vrbo role, add: "Drove user segmentation strategy via CDP implementation"
(mirrors their exact terminology "segmentation strategy")
```

**For Cover Letter:**
- Suggest powerful opening hook (achievement + their need)
- Outline 2-3 paragraph narrative structure
- Strategy for addressing one key gap
