## 🔥 High-Impact Automation Opportunities

### 1. **Job Board Monitoring & Auto-Import** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Current Pain Point:**
- Manual checking of job boards (LinkedIn, company career pages, etc.)
- Copy-pasting job descriptions into `/analyze-job`

**n8n Solution:**
```
Workflow: Job Board Monitor
├── Trigger: Cron (every 4 hours)
├── LinkedIn Jobs API / Web Scraper
│   └── Filter: Product Lead/Manager roles in London
├── Check if job already analyzed (compare with existing applications/)
├── If NEW job found:
│   ├── Extract job URL & description
│   ├── Save to staging/YYYY-MM-DD-CompanyName.md
│   ├── Send Slack/Email notification: "New job found: [Company] - [Role]"
│   └── Optional: Auto-trigger /analyze-job via Claude API
└── Log to tracking spreadsheet
```

**Integration Points:**

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

### Technical Risks
1. **LinkedIn Terms of Service:** Auto-apply may violate ToS → Use cautiously or skip
2. **API Rate Limits:** Many platforms limit API calls → Implement backoff logic
3. **Authentication Expiry:** OAuth tokens expire → Handle refresh flows
4. **Data Privacy:** Storing credentials securely → Use n8n credentials vault

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with read-only workflows (monitoring, research)
- Add write operations (auto-apply) gradually after testing
- Always include human-in-the-loop for critical actions (application submission)
- Log all automation actions for audit trail
